      <h1>Game Rules</h1>
      <p>
        If a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and any points
        they have accumulated during this turn are forfeited.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rolling a 1 doesn't wipe out your entire score from previous turns, just
        the total earned during that particular roll. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A player can also choose
        to hold (stop rolling the die) if they do not want to take a chance of
        rolling a 1 and losing all of their points from this turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the player chooses to hold, all of the points rolled during that turn
        are added to his or her score. When a total of 100 or
        more points, the game ends and that player is the winner.
